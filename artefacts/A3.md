# A3: User Interface Prototype

This artefact's purporse is to explain in detail the following aspects of our project:
 - The User Interface's (UI) characteristics
 - The project's sitemap
 - Activity diagrams for the different possible user actions
 - Individual design for each of the different pages of the website
 
## 1. Interface and common features

The User Interface of VAPOR consists in a set of web pages built with HTML5, Javascript, CSS3 and the 4.0.0 of the Bootstrap framework.
The latter simplifies the development of fluid, responsive layouts capable of adapting to different device resolutions.
 
The following mockups represent some of VAPOR's general design principles.

## 2. Sitemap

The Sitemap is a visual representation of the relationship between a website's different pages that shows how all the information is related.
It provides a vision of how the website will be contructed and structured and what pages have access to each other, making the information hierarchy clear.
 
> Sitemap presenting the overall structure of the web application.
> Each screen must be identified in the sitemap.
> Multiple pages of the same screen (e.g. student profile in SIGARRA) are presented as page stacks.

A Storyboard describes the required actions a user needs to fulfill in order to reach a certain objective.
