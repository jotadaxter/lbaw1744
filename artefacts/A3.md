# A3: User Interface Prototype

This artefact's purporse is to explain in detail the following aspects of our project:
 - The User Interface's (UI) characteristics
 - The project's sitemap
 - Activity diagrams for the different possible user actions
 - Individual design for each of the different pages of the website
 
## 1. Interface and common features

The User Interface of **VAPOR** consists in a set of web pages built with HTML5, Javascript, CSS3 and the 4.0.0 of the Bootstrap framework.
The latter simplifies the development of fluid, responsive layouts capable of adapting to different device resolutions.
 
The following mockups represent some of **VAPOR**'s general design principles.

These pictures contain the base structure of every page:
 - Every page uses a fluid layout in order to adapt to different device resolutions
 - Users can always return to the main page by clicking the **VAPOR** logo on the upeer left corner
 - Users can access more specific details and features regarding their account by clicking on their username on the upper right corner
 - Users can access their their cart anytime, authenticated or otherwise, by clicking on the cart icon
 - Users that are authenticated can access their notifications page by clicking on the bell icon
 - The website's front end is inspired by the retro look of webpages from the 1990's, while still appearing modern and easy to use

## 2. Sitemap

The Sitemap is a visual representation of the relationship between a website's different pages that shows how all the information is related.
It provides a vision of how the website will be contructed and structured and what pages have access to each other, making the information hierarchy clear.
