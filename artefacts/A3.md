# A3: User Interface Prototype

This artefact's purporse is to explain in detail the following aspects of our project:
 - The _User Interface_'s (UI) characteristics
 - The project's sitemap
 - Activity diagrams for the different possible user actions
 - Individual design for each of the different pages of the website
 
## 1. Interface and common features

The _User Interface_ of _**VAPOR**_ consists in a set of web pages built with HTML5, JavaScript, CSS 3 and the 3.3.7 of the Bootstrap framework.
The latter simplifies the development of fluid, responsive layouts capable of adapting to different device resolutions.
 
The following mockups represent some of _**VAPOR**_'s general design principles.

1. Website header, featuring Sign In/Register buttons, the visitor's Cart, Logo, Search Bar and User profile dropdown (if the user is logged in)
2. Categories list, from where the _User_ can choose from when searching for products
3. Home page's main slideshow, featuring the current most popular products, discounts and promotions
4. Website's footer, featuring links to the About page, Contacts page, Terms of Service page and Privacy page
5. Secondary featuring products (currently trending, top sellers, recomendations based on the user's history, etc.)

1. List of products that match the _User_'s search filters/tags/categories. It features the _Product_'s name with a small image, available plataforms, rating, price and discounts. _Products_ can be sorted by price, release date, rating, discount or name
2. List of tags the user can use to filter results in order to find a product that fits its needs
3. Quick access tab to the Top Selling, Trending, Latest or Random products

2. Area dedicated to user feedback regarding the _Product_ in the form of ratings and reviews
3. Recomendations of similar products or frequently searched related products by other users

These pictures contain the base structure of every page:
 - Every page uses a fluid layout in order to adapt to different device resolutions
 - Users can always return to the main page by clicking the _**VAPOR**_ logo on the upper left corner
 - Users can access more specific details and features regarding their account by clicking on their username on the upper right corner
 - Users can access their their cart anytime, authenticated or otherwise, by clicking on the cart icon
 - Users that are authenticated can access their notifications page by clicking on the bell icon
 - The website's front end is inspired by the _Vaporwave_ aesthetic, while remaining as modern and easy to use

## 2. Sitemap

The _Sitemap_ is a visual representation of the relationship between a website's different pages that shows how all the information is related.
It provides a vision of how the website will be contructed and structured, and what pages have access to each other, making the information hierarchy clear.

## 3. Storyboards

A _Storyboard_ describes the required actions a user needs to fulfill in order to reach a certain objective.
Each _Storyboard_ is a sequence of interfaces explaining how navigation within the website's pages (presented in the following section of this artefact) is made.
 
 The following storyboards explain certain actions through examples using screenshots from the current version of the website:
 
 ![image 52 - Register](/images/storyboards/a3_register.jpg "Optional Title")  
 Image 52 - Register
 
 ![image 53 - Login](/images/storyboards/a3_login.jpg "Optional Title")  
 Image 53 - Login
 
 ![image 54 - Buy Product](/images/storyboards/a3_buy.jpg "Optional Title")

 Example of navigation through the user's dropdown box of options:
 
 ![image 55 - User Profile](/images/storyboards/a3_profile.jpg "Optional Title")  
 Image 55 - User Profile
 
 Example of navigation through the website's footer options:
 
 ![image 56 - About](/images/storyboards/a3_about.jpg "Optional Title")  
 Image 56 - About
 
  ![image 56 - Edit Profile](/images/storyboards/edit_profile.png "Optional Title")
