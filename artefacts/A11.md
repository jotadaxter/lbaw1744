## 1. Product presentation
 
"Vapor" is a online software store largely inspired by the popular digital distribution platform Steam.
As such, Vapor's goal is to act as a center for the acquisition and sale of software products, free or paid.
Users can submit their products and put them up for sale, or search through a huge selection of products, filter results resorting to tags and buy products, rate and review said products and/or put them in a wishlist for future consultation.

Regarding Vapor's administration, an admin user should be able to ban users or edit their view and action permissions, remove and/or add products for sale and  consult a list of users and products.
