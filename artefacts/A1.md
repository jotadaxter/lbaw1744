# A1: Online Shop - ＶＡＰＯＲ 蒸気
 
Our project consists of an online software shop that allows, in a practical and fast manner, the search, purchase and sale of software products, as well as allowing users to rate the quality of both products and sellers.
The online shop model we have in mind is largely based on the popular online gaming platform Steam and inspired not only by its success and convenience, but also by its role as a method of anti-piracy.
The project’s website’s main characteristics include the division of all products by sections, the search of specific products according to certain parameters set by the user and the possibility of leaving a rating and/or review on a certain product and/or seller.

A visitor of the website will be able to register himself, sign in, see and search for products.

A member of the website may logout, see and search for products, purchase or add a product for sale, rate and review products and their corresponding sellers and edit his profile.
External interfaces may be used as an alternative registry/authentication method (ex.: Facebook, Google+), so as to ease the process, and improve connectivity between services.
Each user profile contains the user’s name, location, contact, “wishlist” (list of products the user wishes to acquire) and purchase/review/rating/search history.
Registered users will also be able to receive recommendations on products, given their purchase and search history, and follow specific sellers, in order to stay up-to-date on their latest products.

Should a registered user become a seller, he’ll also be able to see his reputation and reviews, same for his products, as well as a list of all, his most sold and/or highest rated products.

Administrators extend the functionality of a user, and may modify (moderate) or remove the site’s content (ex.: abusive or offensive content, duplicate entries, etc.), as well as ban users who do not follow the rules of conduct, or even access or block certain locations of the site, if required.
