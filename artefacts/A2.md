# A2: Actors and User stories

In this artefact, we specify all actors and associated user stories within the context of our project.
These shall be regarded as the requirements of the system we'll be implementing.
 
## A2.1 Actors

An _Actor_ specifies a role played by an entity that interacts with the subject, but which is external to the system.
_Actors_ may represent roles played by human users, external hardware, etc.
