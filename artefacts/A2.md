# A2: Actors and User stories

In this artefact, we specify all the actors and their associated user stories within the context of our project.
These shall be regarded as the requirements of the system we are to implement.
 
## A2.1 Actors

An Actor specifies a role played by an entity that interacts with the subject, but which is external to the system.
Actors may represent roles played by human users, external hardware, etc.
